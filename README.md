CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

- For this MEAN stack development project we used Express HTML as a way to route pages upon client request. The code itself was written in JavaScript with OOP methodology. JavaScript is perfect for this framework because of client side usage benefits. It provides speed, works well with other languages, and reduces server load. The SPA is used to reduce server calls and further increase site load speed since it only needs to load the page once. 

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

- MongoDB is a very good database when it comes to managing huge data. Documents are stored in a collection which identifies data through the use of keys. It also allows you to add keys later without having to modify existing data, it contains powerful querying, and it also provides an impressive speed as well because of no need to create a table or schema. 

## Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

- JSON is a file format while JavaScript is a scripting language. AngularJS and NodeJS use JSON while MongoDB stores the data in the JSON format. It is also great for larger projects. Throughout the application we use JSON and there is no need to reformat the data.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

- Using handlebars we refactored code into header and footer partials and converted the views to dynamically load information directly from the database.

## Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

- Endpoints work in tandem with API methods. Methods are permitted requests that can be made, such as GET, DELETE, PATCH or POST. We can set authentication requirements using tokens or certificates so that the latter are required before any of these methods can be called. This adds a security layer as to who can access specific endpoints.

## Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

- This coarse contained a lot of usefull information which really went in depth on how a full stack web application can be created, modified and secured. MEAN stack development is a very popular type of web application development and understanding it will help greatly in my career as a developer. It brought together how everything is interconnected in a full stack application and taught it well. This course also taught me a lot about perseverence with coding because there were a few bumps in the road to creating this application and I had to do a lot of trial and error testing. Knowing and understanding full stack development is a huge stepping stone and will make me a more marketable candidate in my career.
